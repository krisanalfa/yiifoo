WHAT IS Yii Foo
---------------

It's an archetype, a skeleton of an application built with Yii2 Framework.

WHY SHOULD I USE Yii Foo
------------------------

You **shouldn't** use this skeleton if you want to build a real application.
This skeleton mainly purposed to **quick learn about Yii2 application lifecycle**.
I made it as simple, barebone, light, and free pollutant as possible.
It's really easy to understand.

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-------------------

```
app/       Application source code, following PSR-4 coding standard
bootstrap/ Application bootstrap (initialization of application)
config/    A place to store your configuration
public/    A public folder for HTTP web server
views/     A place where you store view files.
```

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by Yii is that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.
